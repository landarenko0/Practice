Hello! This repository contains my educational practice. It is symbol chain analyzer. You can find the code for a particular block in the corresponding file. For example,
the file transliterator.py contains transliterator code and so on.
If the chain corresponds to the form "repeat <function_name>($<hex_number> <arythm_sign> <variable_name>) until <variable name> <compare_sign> <integer>;", then string
"ACCEPTED" will be added in file "OUTPUT.txt". Else, string "REJECTED" will be added in that file.
